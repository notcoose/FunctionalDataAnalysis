# Functional Data Analysis

This repository holds the code for our [MURL](https://murl.uic.edu/list-of-projects-past-and-future/fall-2024/) project on Functional Data Analysis

## Usage

The code is in the form of Python Jupyter Notebooks so checking out the code is as simple as opening up [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Lab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab/) and either importing these notebooks (and datasets) or cloning the repository
